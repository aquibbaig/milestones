# milestones

### Background

Milestones is a # 2 for my student Utility applications in the repository. The code is Open Source and I hope you will like it.

### About

Milestones is a Web Application made using React.js, Node.js using Express as a framework and MongoDB mlab instance as a database. It is a student Utility application that makes him/her set goals and work upon them. It is the single platform where you can set up your weekly milestones, your todos and even set up your time-table.

### Rise Of Pomodoro

Milestones is based on the current invention of a time saving model called as the Pomodoro technique which is used by students to concentrate better on studies. The technique is in beta and will be fully updated and optimised in the application. You can refer to how to properly use this technique on Google.

### How to set up
1. Clone the repository
2. cd server followed by npm i and cd client followed by npm i
3. You're good to go with the environment now.
4. For the application to run, cd server/ and nodemon start for server and cd client/ and npm start for the    client
